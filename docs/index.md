# Overview

!!! danger "Current status"
    
    This branch reflects the upcoming release of the bindings for Vert.x 5:
    
    - some modules have been removed,
    - the generator has been rewritten and does not use `vertx-codegen` annotation processing anymore.
    
    We will update the documentation as we near a stable release.
