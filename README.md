This contains a set of modules helping the development of reactive applications in SmallRye 

## Vert.x Mutiny Clients

[Mutiny](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny) is a novel approach to deal with Reactive APIs.
The `vertx-mutiny-clients` module contains the Vert.x client API using the Mutiny model (`Uni` and `Multi`).

It also contains the Vert.x code generator.

## Reactive Converters

Reactive converters are a set of library to convert types uses by various libraries from/to `Publisher` and `CompletionStage`.
Documentation is available in [the reactive-converters directory](./reactive-converters/readme.adoc).

## Vert.x Axle Clients - deprecated

This module delivers Vert.x client using the _Axle_ API. 

The _Axle_ API is based on `CompletionStage` and `Publisher`.
